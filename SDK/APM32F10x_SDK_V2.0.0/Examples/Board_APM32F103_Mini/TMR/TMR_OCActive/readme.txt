&par Example Description

The program to show how to configure the TMR2 peripheral to generate 4 different
signals with four different delays.

  - SystemCoreClock = 72MHz.
  - TMR2CLK = SystemCoreClock = 72 MHz.Prescaler = 71, TMR counter clock = 1 MHz
  - TMR2_Period    = (1000000 / 1000) - 1
  - TMR2 CH1 pulse = 800
  - TMR2 CH1 delay = 800/1MHz = 800us
  - TMR2 CH2 pulse = 600
  - TMR2 CH2 delay = 600/1MHz = 600us
  - TMR2 CH3 pulse = 400
  - TMR2 CH3 delay = 400/1MHz = 400us
  - TMR2 CH4 pulse = 200
  - TMR2 CH4 delay = 200/1MHz = 200us

The CHx delay correspond to the time difference between PE6 falling edge and TMR2_CHx signal
rising edges. Reset system and display TMR2 waveform by oscilloscope.

&par Hardware Description

  - using TMR2 Channel 1 (PA0) to output signal
  - using TMR2 Channel 2 (PA1) to output signal
  - using TMR2 Channel 3 (PA2) to output signal
  - using TMR2 Channel 4 (PA3) to output signal
