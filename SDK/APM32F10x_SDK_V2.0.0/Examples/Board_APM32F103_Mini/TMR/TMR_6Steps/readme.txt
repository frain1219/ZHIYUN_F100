&par Example Description

The program to show how to configure the TMR1 peripheral to generate 6 Steps.
In this example, a software COM event is generated each 100 milliseconds.

The TMR1 is configured in Timing Mode, each time a COM event occurs, a new TMR1
configuration will be set in advance.

A  =  Channel 1
A' =  Channel 1N
B  =  Channel 2
B' =  Channel 2N
C  =  Channel 3
C' =  Channel 3N

  - Step1
  - A & B'
  - Step2
  - B' & C
  - Step3
  - C & A'
  - Step4
  - A' & B
  - Step5
  - B & C'
  - Step6
  - C' & A

Display TMR1 waveform by oscilloscope.

&par Hardware Description

  - using TMR1 Channel 1  (PA8)  to output PWM
  - using TMR1 Channel 1N (PB13)  to output PWM
  - using TMR1 Channel 2  (PA9) to output PWM
  - using TMR1 Channel 2N (PB14) to output PWM
  - using TMR1 Channel 3  (PA10) to output PWM
  - using TMR1 Channel 3N (PB15) to output PWM
