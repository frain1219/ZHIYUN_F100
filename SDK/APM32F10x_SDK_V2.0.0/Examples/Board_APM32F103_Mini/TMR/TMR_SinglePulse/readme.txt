&par Example Description

This example shows how to config TMR peripherals to generate a Single Pulse
with an external trigger

  - TMR1 Configure Single Pulse Mode and Enable event is used as Trigger Output
  - The TMR1 peripherals clock is 72MHz.
  - Configure Timer TMR1 counter clock at 36 MHz:
  - TMR1 counter clock = (72M)/ (1 + 1) = 36MHz

  - TMR1->AUTORLD is 32767, so the trigger input max frequency value
  - is 36MHz/32767 = 1.098KHz .
  - TMR1 pulse = 7200
  - Single Pulse delay value = 7200/(72MHz/2) = 200us
  - And the pulse value is fixed to single pulse value
  - Pulse value = (period - pulse)/counter clock
  - = (32767- 7200)/ 36MHz = 710us

&par Hardware Description

  - using TMR1 CHANNEL1(PA8) to output Pulse by TMR1 CHANNEL2(PA9)
  - using TMR1 CHANNEL2(PA9) connect the external signal
