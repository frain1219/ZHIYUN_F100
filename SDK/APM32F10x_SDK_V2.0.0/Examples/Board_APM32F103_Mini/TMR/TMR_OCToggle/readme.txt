&par Example Description

The program to show how to configure the TMR2 peripheral to generate 4 waveform
with 4 different frequencies (2.5KHz, 5KHz, 25KHz and 50KHz).

  - SystemCoreClock = 72 MHz.
  - TMR2CLK = SystemCoreClock = 72 MHz.Prescaler = 0, TMR counter clock = 72 MHz

  - The TMR2 CC1 register = 72MHz/5000
  - CC1 update rate = 5KHz
  - Channel 1 waveform frequency = 2.5KHz

  - The TMR2 CC2 register = 72MHz/10000
  - CC2 update rate = 10KHz
  - Channel 2 waveform frequency = 5KHz

  - The TMR2 CC3 register = 72MHz/50000
  - CC3 update rate = 50KHz
  - Channel 3 waveform frequency = 25KHz

  - The TMR2 CC4 register = 72MHz/100000
  - CC4 update rate = 100KHz
  - Channel 4 waveform frequency = 50KHz

Display TMR2 waveform by oscilloscope.

&par Hardware Description

  - using TMR2 Channel 1 (PA0) to output waveform 
  - using TMR2 Channel 2 (PA1) to output waveform 
  - using TMR2 Channel 3 (PA2) to output waveform 
  - using TMR2 Channel 4 (PA3) to output waveform
