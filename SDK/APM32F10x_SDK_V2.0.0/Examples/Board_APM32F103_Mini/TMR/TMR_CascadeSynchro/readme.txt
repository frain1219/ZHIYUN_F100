&par Example Description

This example shows how to synchronize TMR peripherals in cascade mode.

  - cascade mode:
  - TMR2 Master for TMR3, Configure PWM Mode and TMR2 Update event is used as Trigger Output
  - TMR3 is slave for TMR2 and Master for TMR4,
  - Config PWM Mode and TMR3 Update event is used as Trigger Output
  - The ITR1(TMR2) is used as input trigger
  - TMR4 is slave for TMR3,
  - Config PWM Mode
  - The ITR2(TMR3) is used as input trigger

  - The TMR2 peripherals clock is 72M.

  - The Master Timer TMR2 frequency:
  - TMR2 frequency = (72M)/ (71 + 1) = 1 MHz
  - duty cycle = 36/ (71 + 1) = 50%.

  - The TMR3 is running at:
  - (1 MHz)/ (99 + 1) = 10 KHz
  - duty cycle = 50/ (99 + 1) = 50%

  - The TMR4 is running at:
  - (10 KHz)/ (9 + 1) = 1 KHz
  - duty cycle = 5/ (9 + 1) = 50%

&par Hardware Description

  - using TMR2 CHANNEL1(PA0) to output PWM
  - using TMR3 CHANNEL1(PA6) to output PWM
  - using TMR4 CHANNEL1(PB6) to output PWM
