&par Example Description

The program to show how to use DMA to transfer Data from
memory to TMR1 Capture Compare Register1 to change the Duty Cycle.

  - TMR1 Repetition counter =   6
  - SystemCoreClock         =   72 MHz.
  - TMR1CLK                 =   SystemCoreClock
  - Prescaler               =   71
  - TMR1 counter clock      =   1 MHz
  - TMR1_Period             =   (1000000 / 1000) - 1

each 6 Update Requests, the TMR1 Channel 1 Duty Cycle changes to the next new value:
  - value1 = 800
  - Channel 1 duty cycle = 80%
  - Channel 1N duty cycle = 20%
  - value2 = 400
  - Channel 1 duty cycle = 40%
  - Channel 1N duty cycle = 60%
  - value3 = 200
  - Channel 1 duty cycle = 20%
  - Channel 1N duty cycle = 80%

Display TMR1 waveform by oscilloscope.

&par Hardware Description

  - using TMR8 Channel 1 (PA8) to output PWM
  - using TMR8 Channel 1N (PB13) to output PWM
