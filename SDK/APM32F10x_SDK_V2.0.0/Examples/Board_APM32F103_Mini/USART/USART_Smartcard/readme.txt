&par Example Description

The program shows how to using USART Smartcard mode, in this case,
USART1 sends data to upper computer. You can check the data in a Serial Port Utility.

  - USART1 configured as follow:
  - BaudRate    = 115200
  - Word Length = USART_WordLength_8b
  - Stop Bit    = USART_StopBits_1
  - Parity      = USART_Parity_No
  - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
  - Transmit enabled

Smartcard USART (USART3) configured as follow:
  - BaudRate    = 12096 baud
  - Word Length = 9 Bits
  - 1.5 Stop Bit
  - Even parity
  - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
  - Tx and Rx enabled
  - USART Clock enabled
  - USART CPOL Low
  - USART CPHA on first edge
  - USART Last Bit Clock Enabled

To use this example, the user needs to prepare a smart card module.
  PB10 (USART3_TX) ---> Smartcard Tx Pin
  PB11 (Pin)       ---> Smartcard Reset Pin
  PB12 (USART3_CK) ---> Smartcard CK Pin
