&par Example Description

The program shows how to use USART LIN mode, in this case,
USART1 sends data to upper computer. You can check the data in a Serial Port Utility.

USART1 configured as follow:
  - BaudRate    = 115200
  - Word Length = USART_WordLength_8b
  - Stop Bit    = USART_StopBits_1
  - Parity      = USART_Parity_No
  - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
  - Transmit enabled

USARTx configured as follow:
  - BaudRate    = 9600 baud
  - Word Length = 8 Bits
  - Stop Bit    = USART_StopBits_1
  - Parity      = USART_Parity_No
  - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
  - Receive and transmit enabled
  - Enable the LIN mode

To use this example, the user needs to prepare two LIN modules.

   PA2(USART2_TX)  <--->  PB11(USART3_RX)
   PA3(USART2_RX)  <--->  PB10(USART3_TX)
