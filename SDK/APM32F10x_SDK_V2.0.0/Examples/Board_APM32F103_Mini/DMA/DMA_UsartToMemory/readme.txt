&par Example Description

This example provides a basic communication between USART1 and USART2 using DMA1
capability.

After system reset, the DMA transfers data from DMA_USART_TxBuf buffer to USART2 
Transmit data register, then this data is sent to USART1. Data received by USART1 
is transferred by DMA and stored in DMA_USART_RxBuf. Then compared with the two 
buffers, If the data of DMA_USART_TxBuf and DMA_USART_RxBuf are the same, LED2 will 
light, otherwise LED3 will light.

&par Hardware Description

USART2_TX (PA2)  --->  USART1_RX (PA10)

The USART1 and USART2 is configured as follows:
    - USART1 TX:PA9, RX:PA10, USART2 TX:PA2, RX:PA3
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Receive and transmit enabled
