&par Example Description

This example describes how to use NVIC priority.
At startup, press KEY1(PA1) to occur enter EINT1 Interrupt, and device will enter Infinite loop mode.
The device will enter higher priority EINT0 Interrupt if press KEY2.
Now press KEY1 again will not enter EINT1 Interrupt.
The status of device is displayed on serial assistant through USART1.

&par Hardware Description

EINT1  is connected to PA1(KEY1)
EINT0  is connected to PA0(KEY2)
