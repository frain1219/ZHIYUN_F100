&par Example Description

This example describes how to use the usb host to enum a U disk.
And use FATFS to write and read file to U disk.Press KEY1 to write file to U disk and
press KEY2 to read file from U disk.

&par Hardware Description

The USART1 is configured as follows:
    - TX:PA9, RX:PA10
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Receive and transmit enabled

    - OTG_FS_VBUS(PA9) ----------> X(Use to USART1)
    - OTG_FS_ID(PA10)  ----------> X(Use to USART1)
    - VCC5V            ----------> VBUS
    - OTG_FS_DM(PA11)  ----------> USB_DN
    - OTG_FS_DP(PA12)  ----------> USB_DP
    - GND              ----------> GND
